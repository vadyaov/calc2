@node General information
@chapter General information

The calculator is developed in the C++17 programming language using MVC pattern.
Interface for this calculator was made using QT.
The main principle of calculations is implemented on the basis of Dijkstra's algorithm, the essence of which is to convert mathematical expressions from infix notation to reverse Polish notation.

@node  Arithmetic operations
@chapter  Arithmetic operations

The following arithmetic operations are implemented in the calculator:
@enumerate
@item
Addition - a + b
@item
Subtraction - a - b
@item
Multiplication - a * b
@item
Division - a / b
@item
Power - a ^ b
@item
Remainder of the division - a mod b
@item
Unary plus - +a
@item
Unary minus - -a
@item
To enter complex expressions use left and right brackets - (a)
@end enumerate
You can specify a complex mathematical expression using the constant "x".
Enter the expression, click "=" and get the answer.

@node Math function
@chapter Math function

The following mathematical functions are implemented in the calculator:
@enumerate
@item

@end enumerate
Enter the expression, click "=" and get the answer.

@node Charts
@chapter Charts

The calculator implements the possibility of plotting functions.
In order to build a graph, enter the expression, click the "plot" button and then click "=" button.
The graph will appear.

@node Credit calculator

Interest Rate - the desired interest rate. Set as an integer or a floating-point number.
@item
Annulling button - for annulling payments.
@item
Monthly button - for differentiated payments.
@end enumerate
Output Fields: 
@enumerate
@item
Monthly payment.
@item
Overpayment on the loan (interest).
@item
The total amount to be paid.
@end enumerate

Press 'Calculate' to see the result.
